    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="p1">
        My names are hitimana david, undergraduate student at middlesex university living in london.<br>
        Blurbs are important because they quickly give potential business contacts the most relevant<br>
        information about you. Because an “About Me” can be less formal than a candidate profile on a<br>
        resume, it can also be a chance to use humor or a personal story to help the reader become<br>
        familiar with you
